# Muthra_Detection_yolov5

## Overview

This repository contains code for detecting Muthra (a specific object or entity) using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning object detection model. The project aims to identify and localize instances of Muthra in images or video frames.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrakashDSdeveloper/Muthra_Detection_yolov5
   cd muthra_detection_yolov5
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run Muthra detection on an image:

```bash
python detect.py --source path/to/your/image.jpg
```

For real-time detection on webcam:

```bash
python detect.py --source 0
```

For more options and parameters, refer to the [official YOLOv5 documentation](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## Dataset

Describe the dataset used for training, including its structure, format, and any preprocessing steps applied.

## Training

If you want to train the model on your own dataset:

1. Prepare your dataset following the YOLOv5 dataset format.
2. Adjust training configurations in `train.yaml`.
3. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data your_data.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --batch-size 16
   ```

## Inference

To perform inference on new data after training, use the `detect.py` script. Example usage:

```bash
python detect.py --source path/to/your/image.jpg --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on a validation set using:

```bash
python val.py --data your_data.yaml --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt
```

## Customization

Describe how users can customize the project, add new classes, or modify configurations.

## Results

Include any notable results, metrics, or visualizations obtained from your trained model.
